De-Orbit: Space Preservation Mission

De-Orbit is an interactive web-based simulation that addresses the growing crisis of space debris. Developed as a tribute to orbital security, the project combines real-time satellite tracking with gamified cleanup mechanics.
 Key Features

  - Real-Time ISS Tracking:
     Integrates satellite.js to calculate and render the International Space Station's current position over Earth.

- Interactive 3D Earth:
  Custom shader-based rendering featuring dynamic day/night cycles and atmospheric cloud layers.

- Mission Mechanics:
  Three specialized tools (Laser, Net, Harpoon) designed to neutralize specific classes of space junk.

- Educational Outreach:
  Includes a "Guardian Merit Award" system and direct links to real-time orbital data to bridge the gap between gaming and reality.

 Technical Stack

  - Engine: Three.js (WebGL)
  - Calculations: SGP4 Propagator
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS & Cinzel typography
  - Data Source: TLE (Two-Line Element) sets for orbital positioning

 How to Play

    Scan: Move your reticle over orbiting objects to identify them.

    Match: Switch to the correct tool (e.g., Use the Harpoon for satellites).

    De-Orbit: Click to engage. Watch as the debris spirals into the atmosphere to burn up.
